# PythonMining
Data Mining of the tweets using python 3.3.6 and tweepy 3.5.

This is the project I done in my Minor during B.tech. Later I switched to R Language from Python so this is just the instance of the whole project how I got started.

The project aims at extracting the data from twitter by mining the data using "tweepy" library provided by twitter.

How to run the project : 

Install python(3.3.6) for good compatibility and tweepy(V3.5)
Set up the environment on your local machine.

Install the tweepy library by running the following command in your command prompt:

          pip install tweepy
          
This will install the tweepy into your machine and you're good to go.

Clone the repository and on your command prompt navigate to the directory and run the following command as per your requirements:

        python twitter_search.py query -c 50
        
This will extract the data from the twitter and create a csv file for 50 entries.

Rest of the information is given in the code as comments.

Feel free to explore.
